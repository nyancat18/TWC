    <h1 class="full-widtgh"><em>What is The World in Context?<br><br></em></h1>
    <p><strong>I started The World in Context out of
frustration</strong>—with how difficult it is to just follow the news and be informed. There are so many poor sources of information, so many biases to consider.
      <br>
      <br><em>It’s almost like everyone has to be their own journalist. And that takes a lot of time—and a lot of
effort.</em> &nbsp;
      <br>
      <br> Let me do that for you. I’ll bring you a daily rundown of the biggest news stories, important stuff that’s hidden beneath the headlines, and why it all matters—every Monday through Friday.
      <br>
      <br>I'll be as objective as possible, and do my best to add context to every story. I mark a clear divide between the news and my analysis, so you can draw your own conclusions.
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="old-home.html"><strong>Give The World in Context a try!</strong></a> I think you’ll find it useful. &nbsp;
      <br>
      <br>And if you do - spread it around to your friends. I'd greatly appreciate it!
      <br>
      <br>--
      <br>
      <br>Cheers,
      <br>
